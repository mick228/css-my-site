          <h3>I'm learning to code</h3>
          <p>learning to code is not a easy work but as current circumstance this covid-19 disease spread every where this is a good time for me to learn code i am able to focus in my programing rather than my main work which is my shop and i am learning to code so i can build my website and come in to e-commerce business but as i got in e-commerce business i learn that i have a lot of different thing's to learn to be able to build my website and programing is the main tool to build a website from scratch .</p>

          <h3>Programing isn't a piece of cake</h3>
          <p class="img-2-peragraph">as i started doing programing first i learn about html via w-3 school,mdn and to be honest i think is this how easy programing is i mean html contain tag's and it has some of the attributes of that tags and i learned all the basic's of html in 2-days only i thought i will be a programmer in no time until i was introduce to 'css'and then i realise how programing is the pain in the ass css's box model positioning and all that intermidiate stull is taking a lot of time to learn but as this covid-19 shit happens i have got a lot of time to lear yet i have a lot of other lanuage's remain to learn like java-script,python and a lot more i didnt even know name of them right now because i am sticking to one until i understand it.</p>
